For step 5, I used 100 as number of total voters, and 200 and 150 as the votes for each candidate. Apparently it would be impossible for the number of votes for a single candidate to be larger than the number of total votes, but the program is unaware of the problem and outputs 200% and 150%.

For the logic error, I twisted the comparison of voter percentage in line 30, so that even though the program can be compiled and run, the output of election prediction is incorrect.

For the compile error, I first created a name error by deleting the "using namespace std;" declaration on line 5 so that calling "cout" and "cin" produces an error as they are not defined. I also created a syntax error on line 8 by taking out a semicolon at the end of the line.

As expected, as I did not finish line 8 with a semicolon, the compiler cannot tell if my last command ends and a new one starts, resulting in a compilation error. In line 12, the compiler outputs that "cout" is not declared in this scope as we did not include "using namespace std;".
